# David Olowokere: Human-Centric GRC Leader

I am a GRC professional dedicated to challenging how we think about security. By exploring the intersection of **human behavior**, **mental processes**, and **business value**, I help organizations move beyond "checkbox compliance" toward true resilience.

## 📜 Qualifications & Certifications

* **B.Sc. Pure and Applied Psychology** | [Adekunle Ajasin University](https://www.aaua.edu.ng/department/psychology)
* **CompTIA Security+**                 | [Verify Badge via Credly](https://www.credly.com/badges/29df99cc-6fe0-4002-a472-563ba1bae9f0/public_url)
* **Google Cybersecurity Professional** | [Verify Badge via Credly](https://www.credly.com/badges/211507ca-c0e4-4e36-bb22-42fddc7e2d85/public_url)


## 🧠 The Behavioral Edge
Security is fundamentally a human problem. I apply behavioral science principles to:
* **Risk Culture:** Understanding the *why* behind non-compliance to build better workflows.
* **Control Design:** Creating "low-friction" security controls that align with human cognition.
* **AI Governance:** Navigating the ethical and behavioral risks of human-AI interaction.

## 🎤 Future Outlook
I am currently preparing to share my insights on the conference circuit. I believe that by understanding human behavior, we can better protect business goals and drive sustainable value.
