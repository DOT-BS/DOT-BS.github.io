# Redefining AI Oversight
Artificial Intelligence isn't just a technical shift; it's a behavioral one. In this project, I explore how we can govern AI systems by understanding the mental processes of the users interacting with them.

## The Problem
Traditional GRC frameworks often fail to account for "Shadow AI"—where employees bypass controls because of friction in the user experience.

## My Approach
By applying **behavioral science**, I developed a framework that:
* **Design:** Reduces Friction: This creates intuitive checkpoints that align with business velocity.
* **Feedback** Standardizes Policy: This establishes clear guardrails for LLM usage and data privacy.
* **Culture** Measured Impact: This focuses on reducing ungoverned use cases by 50% through psychological nudges rather than rigid blocks.
