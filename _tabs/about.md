# Strategic GRC Leader

I specialize in bridging the gap between technical security and business objectives. My background foocuses on driving measurable GRC outcomes:

* **Audit Success:** Reduced audit findings and accelerated review cycles.
* **Behavioral Edge:** Using my **B.Sc. in Psychology** to design human-centric controls that people actually follow.
* **AI Governance:** Reduced ungoverned AI use cases by 50% through policy standardization.
