# Human Behavior x Digital Risk

I am a GRC professional dedicated to challenging how we think about security. By exploring the intersection of **human behavior**, **mental processes**, and **business value**, I help organizations move beyond "checkbox compliance" toward true resilience.

## 🧠 The Behavioral Edge
Security is often treated as a technical problem, but it is fundamentally a human one. With a **B.Sc. in Pure and Applied Psychology**, I apply behavioral science principles to:
* **Risk Culture:** Understanding the *why* behind non-compliance to build better workflows.
* **Control Design:** Creating "low-friction" security controls that align with human cognition.
* **AI Governance:** Navigating the ethical and behavioral risks of human-AI interaction.
