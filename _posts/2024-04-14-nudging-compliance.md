# From Enforcement to Encouragement

In my previous post, we explored why employees bypass controls due to cognitive friction. Today, we look at the solution: **Nudge Theory**. In GRC, a nudge is not a ‘soft’ control. It is a governance mechanism that shapes behavior without triggering resistance or significantly changing their economic incentives.

## The Problem with "Check-the-Box" Training
Most organizations rely on annual "Security Awareness Training." From a psychological standpoint, this is ineffective because of the **Forgetting Curve**. Information that isn't immediately applicable is lost within days. Training fails not because employees are careless, but because it is temporally disconnected from the moment risk decisions are actually made.

## Applying the Nudge Framework
Instead of annual lectures, we can integrate behavioral nudges directly into the workflow: Compliance happens invisibly, which is the highest-fidelity form of compliance.

### 1. The "Default" Bias
People tend to stick with default settings. By making the "Secure Option" the default in corporate tools (e.g., auto-deleting prompt history in approved LLMs), we ensure compliance without the user having to make a conscious choice.

### 2. Just-in-Time Feedback
Instead of a 404 block page, use a popup: *"It looks like you're trying to use an unapproved AI tool. Our approved tool, [Internal AI], protects company data and is available here."* This reduces **Psychological Reactance** by providing an immediate, safe alternative. Reactance drops when users feel guided instead of corrected.

### 3. Social Norming
Humans are social creatures. Displaying metrics like *"95% of your department is using the secure gateway"* encourages the remaining 5% to align with the "herd" for safety. Social norming works only when the visible norm reflects desired behavior. Broadcasting low adoption backfires.



## The Goal: 50% Reduction in Ungoverned Use
By applying low-friction controls, organizations achieve sustained, visible, low-risk behavior at business speed. The goal is not obedience, but reliability. In environments with high friction and low trust, we have observed reductions of up to 50% in ungoverned tool usage simply by making the right choice the easiest choice.
