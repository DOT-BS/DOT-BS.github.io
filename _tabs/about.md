# David Olowokere: Human-Centric GRC Leader

I am a GRC professional dedicated to challenging how we think about security. By exploring the intersection of **human behavior**, **mental processes**, and **business value**, I help organizations move beyond "checkbox compliance" toward true resilience.

## 📜 Qualifications & Certifications

* **B.Sc. Pure and Applied Psychology** | [Adekunle Ajasin University](https://www.aaua.edu.ng/)
* **CompTIA Security+** |                 [Verify Badge via Credly](https://www.credly.com/your-specific-link) 
* **Google Cybersecurity Professional** | [Verify Badge via Credly](https://www.credly.com/your-specific-link)
* **ISO 27001 Lead Auditor** | [Verify Certificate](https://www.pecb.com/en/verify-certificate)

## 🧠 The Behavioral Edge
Security is fundamentally a human problem. I apply behavioral science principles to:
* **Risk Culture:** Understanding the *why* behind non-compliance to build better workflows.
* **Control Design:** Creating "low-friction" security controls that align with human cognition.
* **AI Governance:** Navigating the ethical and behavioral risks of human-AI interaction.

## 🎤 Future Outlook
I am currently preparing to share my insights on the conference circuit. I believe that by understanding human behavior, we can better protect business goals and drive sustainable value.
